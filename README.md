Hello there!

My name is Aevin S. Bulaong. I'm an aspiring developer and system administrator hoping to become a DevOps engineer. 

I like to tinker and reverse engineer with existing software, whether open source or proprietary, and add my own twist to it. Whether it's to add a new functionality or improve an existing one. Creating projects is how I learn. I like facing new challeneges and finding ways to conquer such challenges.

I'm a team player, as I believe that a strong bond, communication, and understanding is the best way to conquer any problem a team faces. I'm also comfortable working alone, completing any tasks given to me. I'm capable of learning any language, database, or framework quickly, especially if I find it fun to use.

I am proficient in the following language (in no order):
- Java
- PHP
- C# 
- JavaScript
- Python
- HTML
- CSS

I am also familiar with C++, Rust, and Lua, but I have not yet built any significant project with those languages to the point where I would call myself proficient.

I'm also proficient in SQL and NoSQL databases, such as MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and Redis. Although, I'm looking to expand my knowledge for NoSQL-based databases such as MongoDB.

If you would like to contact me, please send me an email: abulaong@gmail.com
