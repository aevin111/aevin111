Hello there!

My name is Aevin S. Bulaong. I'm an aspiring developer and system administrator currently working as a DevOps engineer. 

I like to tinker and reverse engineer existing software, whether open source or proprietary, and either add my own twist to it or build a new software based on it (with my own twist), whether it's to add a new functionality or improve an existing one. 

I am proficient in the following languages (in no order):
- Java
- PHP
- C# 
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python
- C++
- Bash/Unix Shell
- HTML
- CSS

I'm also proficient in SQL and NoSQL databases, such as MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and Redis.

If you would like to contact me, please send me an email: abulaong@gmail.com
